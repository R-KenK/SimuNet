\title{Perform a scan
According to edge presence probability, or a reference adjacency matrix `Adj` coupled with a sample effort `total_scan`, perform a scan in the form of a theoretical binary adjacency matrix, and simulate the empirical obtention of a group scan and/or focal scan. If the optimization for rare even is used, performs a scan knowing that at least one edge has been observed in the theoretical scan.}
\usage{
do.scan(
  Adj = NULL,
  total_scan = NULL,
  method = c("theoretical", "group", "focal", "both"),
  ...,
  use.rare.opti = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Adj}{square integers matrix of occurences of dyads. Optional if using presence.prob. Update: now if presence prob is passed as Adj (thus all(Adj<1) is TRUE), it will be rightfully assigned to presence.prob. WIP: implement method for association matrices...}

\item{total_scan}{integer, sampling effort. Note that 1/total_scan should be relatively small, increasingly small with increasing precision. Optional if using presence.prob.}

\item{method}{Character scalar, specifies if the function should return a theoretical perfect group scan, an  empirical group scan (a similarly dimensioned matrix as Adj), or a focal scan (a vector representing the given focal's row in the group scan matrix).}

\item{...}{additional argument to be used, to use produce a scan in a desired way.#'
\itemize{
  \item{obs.prob}{either :
    \item{"a dyad observation obs.probability matrix"}{of same dimension as Adj}
    \item{"a dyad observation vector"}{subsetted similarly as Adj (through the non.diagonal() function for instance)}
    \item{"a general dyad observation obs.probability"}{should be in [0,1], assumed to be the case when only one value is inputed)}
  }
  \item{focal}{Only required for method = "focal" or "both" Character scalar, indicate which focal to consider for the scan.}
  \item{Adj.subfun}{subsetting function of the adjacency matrix. Driven by igraph "mode" argument}
  \item{presence.prob} {square probability matrix of presence (as in Bernouilli trial) of dyads. Optional if using Adj and total_scan.}
  \item{mode} {Character scalar, specifies how igraph should interpret the supplied matrix. Default here is directed. Possible values are: directed, undirected, upper, lower, max, min, plus. Added vector too. See details \link[igraph]{graph_from_adjacency_matrix}.}
}}

\item{use.rare.opti}{logical: should the optimization for rare event be used?}
}
\value{
a list of the theoretical square binary matrix representing the whole group scan, and:
\itemize{
 \item{"method = theoretical"}{that's all,}
 \item{"method = group"}{the empirical group scan square binary matrix}
 \item{"method = focal"}{the empirical focal scan binary vector (and the focal identity as a "focal" attribute)}
 \item{"method = both"}{or the three above}
 }
