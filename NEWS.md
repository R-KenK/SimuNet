# SimuNet 0.1.0
* Imported simulation-oriented functions from ConfiNet
* Structure package till it checks ok on its own
* Commented and removed mention of `decide_use.rare.opti()` for now till this routine is cleaned. Updated examples in `Boot_scans()` and bootstrap tools to not call for this function through setting `use.rare.opti = FALSE`
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
